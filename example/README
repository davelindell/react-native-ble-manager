Instructions for setting up bluetooth communication for the mobile app and 
raspi 

-- setting up the mobile app

Note that this assumes you have already connected a physical
android device (with usb debugging enabled), or are running an emulator.
Emulator won't give full functionality though because you need to be able
to send/receive over bluetooth.

run the following
$ npm install # install required node packages
$ react-native link # link required libraries
$ npm start # start development server
$ react-native run-android # start the android app on phone
$ react-native log-android # view logging from the android app

Hopefully the app is installed on your android phone now.


-- setting up the raspberry pi

I basically followed this guide to use bleno to control the 
raspi BLE module. Bleno is a bluetooth api for node js.

1. the rapsbian distros come with bluetooth enabled, but it messes up
bleno. So stop and disable it
$ sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
$ sudo systemctl disable bluetooth

2. install nodejs and npm
$ sudo apt-get install node
$ sudo apt-get install npm

3. install bleno from npm
$ sudo npm install bleno

4. copy over the files from ./raspi in this directory 
to the raspi

5. ssh into the raspi and run the node BLE peripheral program 
$ sudo node peripheral.js 

6. optionally keep this ssh session open to view the logging from the
BLE peripheral program.
